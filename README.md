# Texas 811 POC - Backend Processing System

A proof-of-concept backend processing system for Texas 811 ticket processing that integrates with CustomGPT for PDF extraction and provides comprehensive GIS parcel enrichment capabilities.

## Overview

This system provides iterative validation, enrichment with geocoding and compliance calculations, state machine-based ticket lifecycle management, and real-time status tracking for Texas 811 locate requests extracted from PDF work orders.

## Key Features

### Core API Capabilities
- **Interactive Validation**: Iterative ticket validation with detailed feedback for CustomGPT integration
- **Compliance Calculations**: Lawful start date computation with Texas holiday awareness
- **State Machine Management**: Complete 14-day ticket lifecycle tracking
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Status monitoring with countdown timers

### GIS Parcel Enrichment
The system now includes comprehensive parcel data enrichment capabilities powered by **ReportAll USA API integration**:

#### Nationwide Coverage
- **All US Counties Supported**: Unlike previous county-specific endpoints, ReportAll USA provides reliable nationwide parcel data coverage
- **Rich Property Information**: Owner details, legal descriptions, parcel IDs, and property addresses
- **High Accuracy**: Professional-grade GIS data from trusted nationwide sources

#### Dedicated Parcel Enrichment Endpoint
**`POST /parcels/enrich`** - Advanced parcel data enrichment with comparison analysis:

**Key Capabilities:**
- Accept address, GPS coordinates, or both for comprehensive analysis
- Detailed discrepancy detection when both address and GPS are provided
- Property owner information and legal descriptions
- Distance calculations and matching field analysis
- Parcel ID cross-reference for verification

**Use Cases:**
- Verify work order locations for accuracy
- Detect discrepancies between provided address and GPS coordinates
- Retrieve property owner information for notifications
- Obtain legal descriptions for precise location documentation
- Validate location data integrity before ticket submission

#### Integration with Existing Pipeline
- **Automatic Enrichment**: All ticket creation and updates now include parcel enrichment
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning if GIS services are unavailable
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-100ms processing time with comprehensive error handling
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all enrichment attempts and results

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **CSS Framework**: TailwindCSS 3.4
- **GIS Services**: ReportAll USA API for nationwide parcel data
- **Deployment**: Railway (Docker containers)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase recommended)
- ReportAll USA API access

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[org]/texas811-poc
   cd texas811-poc
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv install  # Install Python dependencies
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install  # Install Node dependencies
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - **Frontend**: Create `.env.local` with `PORT=3000`
   - **Backend**: Create `.env` with database and API configurations

### Running the Application

**Quick Start (both services):**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**Individual Services:**
- **Frontend**: `npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
- **Backend**: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` (runs on port 8000)

## API Documentation

### Core Endpoints

#### Ticket Management
- `POST /tickets/create` - Create new ticket with validation and parcel enrichment
- `POST /tickets/update` - Update existing ticket with re-enrichment
- `POST /tickets/confirm` - Confirm ticket for submission

#### Parcel Enrichment
- `POST /parcels/enrich` - Standalone parcel data enrichment and comparison

### Parcel Enrichment API

The `/parcels/enrich` endpoint provides comprehensive parcel data enrichment:

```json
POST /parcels/enrich
{
  "address": "1234 Main St, Houston, TX 77002",
  "gps_lat": 29.7604,
  "gps_lng": -95.3698,
  "county": "Harris"
}
```

**Response includes:**
- **address_enrichment**: Parcel data from geocoded address
- **gps_enrichment**: Parcel data from GPS coordinates
- **comparison**: Detailed analysis including:
  - Distance between address and GPS coordinates
  - Parcel ID matching
  - Owner name matching
  - Address matching
  - Overall assessment of whether they represent the same parcel
