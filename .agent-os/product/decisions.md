## 2025-08-31: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a backend API and dashboard for Texas 811 ticket processing that integrates with CustomGPT for PDF extraction. The system will provide iterative validation, enrichment with geocoding and compliance calculations, state machine-based ticket lifecycle management, and a real-time status dashboard. CustomGPT handles all PDF processing and initial user interaction, while our backend handles validation, enrichment, and tracking.

### Context

Utility contractors need to submit Texas 811 locate requests from PDF work orders but face challenges with manual data entry, compliance calculations, and lifecycle tracking. CustomGPT can extract data from PDFs using vision AI, but needs a backend service to validate, enrich, and track tickets through their lifecycle. The POC must demonstrate <5 minute processing time with 95% field accuracy.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Full-Stack PDF Processing Solution**
   - Pros: Complete control over user experience, single system
   - Cons: Duplicates CustomGPT capabilities, longer development time, complex PDF handling

2. **Simple Pass/Fail Validator**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, faster development
   - Cons: No iterative guidance, poor user experience, limited value add

3. **Batch Processing System**
   - Pros: Higher throughput, simpler architecture
   - Cons: No real-time feedback, poor fit for conversational UI, delayed error resolution

### Rationale

The iterative validation API approach was chosen because it:
- Leverages CustomGPT's existing PDF extraction capabilities without duplication
- Provides rich feedback that enables natural conversational gap resolution
- Maintains state across multiple validation attempts for progressive enhancement
- Delivers immediate value through geocoding and compliance calculations
- Creates clear separation of concerns between extraction (CustomGPT) and enrichment (backend)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid POC development by focusing only on backend logic
- Clear API contract enables parallel development with CustomGPT team
- Reusable validation engine for future integrations
- Audit trail naturally captured through API interactions

**Negative:**
- Dependency on CustomGPT availability for end-to-end testing
- API design must accommodate conversational patterns
- Session management adds complexity to handle partial submissions

## 2025-08-31: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Python/FastAPI for backend API, React/TypeScript for dashboard, PostgreSQL via Supabase for persistence, and Railway for deployment. Package management will use uv for Python and npm for JavaScript.

### Context

The POC requires rapid development with production-ready capabilities. The team has Python expertise for backend logic and React experience for dashboards. The system must handle concurrent API requests from CustomGPT while providing real-time dashboard updates.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Django + Server-Side Rendering**
   - Pros: Integrated framework, simpler deployment
   - Cons: Heavier for API-focused backend, less responsive dashboard

2. **Node.js Full Stack**
   - Pros: Single language, shared types
   - Cons: Less mature geocoding libraries, team has stronger Python expertise

3. **Serverless Functions**
   - Pros: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use
   - Cons: Complex session management, cold starts affect user experience

### Rationale

FastAPI provides excellent API documentation, validation, and async support crucial for CustomGPT integration. React enables responsive dashboard with real-time updates. Supabase offers managed PostgreSQL with built-in auth and storage. Railway simplifies deployment with GitHub integration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fast development with familiar tools
- Auto-generated API documentation for CustomGPT integration
- Type safety across frontend and backend
- Managed infrastructure reduces operational overhead

**Negative:**
- Monorepo complexity with mixed languages
- Separate build pipelines for frontend and backend
- Potential CORS configuration challenges

## 2025-08-31: API Design for Iterative Validation

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, CustomGPT Integration Team

### Decision

Implement a single stateful validation endpoint that accepts partial data and returns verbose, structured feedback optimized for CustomGPT's conversational orchestration. Each response includes validation status, missing fields with priority, suggestions, and examples.

### Context

CustomGPT needs to guide users through multi-turn conversations to complete work order data. The API must provide rich feedback that the GPT can transform into natural language prompts while maintaining context across multiple validation attempts.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Two Separate Endpoints (Initial/Final)**
   - Pros: Cleaner separation, simpler individual endpoints
   - Cons: Rigid flow, doesn't support iterative refinement, state synchronization issues

2. **Stateless Validation**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, easier scaling
   - Cons: Redundant data transmission, no progress tracking, poor user experience

3. **WebSocket Real-Time Connection**
   - Pros: Instant feedback, maintains connection
   - Cons: Complex for CustomGPT integration, overkill for POC scope

### Rationale

A single stateful endpoint provides maximum flexibility for CustomGPT to orchestrate conversations naturally. Rich response format enables intelligent question prioritization and helpful suggestions. Session-based state management reduces redundancy while maintaining simplicity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Natural conversational flow with contextual questions
- Progressive enhancement as data improves
- Clear completion signals when ready for submission
- Audit trail of all validation attempts

**Negative:**
- Session management complexity with Redis cache
- API responses require careful structure design
- Testing requires simulating multi-turn interactions
