## Pitch

Texas 811 Backend Processing System is an API-driven enrichment and tracking platform that receives extracted work order data from CustomGPT, provides iterative validation feedback to guide conversational gap resolution, and delivers a dashboard for tracking ticket lifecycles through Texas 811 submission workflows.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Utility Contractors**: Companies using CustomGPT for PDF processing who need iterative validation and tracking
- **Excavation Companies**: Businesses requiring guided data completion and lifecycle management

### User Personas

**Field Operations Manager** (35-50 years old)
- **Role:** Construction/Operations Manager
- **Context:** Uses CustomGPT to extract work order data, relies on backend validation feedback
- **Pain Points:** Incomplete work orders, ambiguous locations, ensuring all fields are valid
- **Goals:** Complete validated packets, minimal clarification rounds, compliance assurance

**Compliance Officer** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** Safety & Compliance Manager
- **Context:** Monitors ticket completeness and lifecycle through dashboard
- **Pain Points:** Tracking validation status, managing deadlines, maintaining audit trails
- **Goals:** 100% field completion, automated compliance checks, clear status visibility

## The Problem

### Iterative Validation Challenge

CustomGPT extracts initial data but needs guidance on what's missing or invalid. Without conversational validation feedback, the GPT cannot effectively prompt users for specific missing information.

**Our Solution:** Interactive API provides detailed validation responses that CustomGPT uses to orchestrate targeted follow-up questions.

### No Conversational Context

Single-pass validation fails when work orders have multiple issues. Teams need a system that maintains context across multiple validation attempts while building toward complete data.

**Our Solution:** Stateful API tracks partial submissions and provides incremental validation feedback.

### Compliance Blind Spots

Even with extracted data, CustomGPT cannot calculate lawful dates or validate addresses against Texas requirements. This leaves compliance gaps that users discover too late.

**Our Solution:** Backend enriches data with geocoding, date calculations, and compliance checks at each iteration.

## Differentiators

### Conversational Validation API

Unlike pass/fail validators, our API returns rich, actionable feedback that CustomGPT transforms into natural conversation. This enables multi-turn interactions that guide users to complete, valid submissions.

### Incremental Progress Tracking

Unlike stateless validators, our backend maintains submission context across API calls. Each iteration builds on previous data, reducing redundant questions and accelerating completion.

### Intelligent Gap Prioritization

Unlike flat error lists, our API prioritizes missing fields by importance and provides context-aware suggestions. This helps CustomGPT ask the most critical questions first.
