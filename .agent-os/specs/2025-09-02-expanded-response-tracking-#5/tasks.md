### 10. Backward Compatibility

**Parent Task:** Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems

- [ ] 10.1 Write tests for legacy field population
- [ ] 10.2 Implement legacy response_date updates
- [ ] 10.3 Write tests for legacy response_status mapping
- [ ] 10.4 Implement status mapping (clear → positive, not_clear → conditional)
- [ ] 10.5 Test API version header support

### 11. Performance Optimization

**Parent Task:** Optimize response operations for performance

- [ ] 11.3 Write performance tests for response list retrieval
- [ ] 11.4 Implement query optimization and caching
- [ ] 11.5 Load test with 20+ members per ticket

### 12. End-to-End Testing

**Parent Task:** Validate complete response workflow

- [ ] 12.1 Write E2E test for complete response workflow
- [ ] 12.2 Write E2E test for unknown member handling
- [ ] 12.3 Write E2E test for dashboard updates
- [ ] 12.4 Test real-time status updates
- [ ] 12.5 Validate all user stories with E2E tests

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-4)
Set up database schema and core business logic with tests.

### Phase 2: API Layer (Tasks 5-7)
Build API endpoints with comprehensive test coverage.

### Phase 3: Frontend (Tasks 8-9)
Implement UI components following component tests.

### Phase 4: Integration (Tasks 10-12)
Ensure backward compatibility and validate complete system.

## Definition of Done

Each task is complete when:
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Implementation code complete
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed for quality
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests

## Time Estimates

- Database & Models (Tasks 1-2): 4 hours
- Business Logic (Tasks 3-4): 3 hours
- API Implementation (Tasks 5-7): 5 hours
- Frontend Components (Tasks 8-9): 6 hours
- Integration & Testing (Tasks 10-12): 4 hours

**Total Estimated Time**: 22 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Migration Complexity**: Test migrations on copy of production schema
- **Performance with Many Members**: Implement pagination if needed
- **Frontend State Management**: Consider using React Query for caching

### Testing Risks
- **Test Data Management**: Create comprehensive fixtures
- **E2E Test Stability**: Use proper wait conditions
- **Performance Test Environment**: Use production-like data volumes

## Success Criteria

- All 12 parent tasks completed with subtasks
- 90%+ unit test coverage
- All E2E tests passing
- Performance requirements met (<500ms response, <200ms retrieval)
- User stories validated through testing
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
