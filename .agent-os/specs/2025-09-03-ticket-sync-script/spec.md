# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Texas811 Ticket Sync Script
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a Python script that synchronizes scraped Texas811 ticket data from JSON files to the backend database using the existing API endpoints. The script will read the scraper output, transform the data as needed, and create or update tickets via the API with full overwrite semantics for updates.

## User Stories

### Automated Ticket Synchronization

As a system administrator, I want to sync scraped ticket data to the database, so that all Texas811 tickets are available in our system for tracking and management.

The workflow involves running the sync script periodically (manually or via cron) to import the latest scraped tickets. The script reads the JSON output from the scraper, checks if each ticket exists in the database, and either creates new tickets or updates existing ones with the latest data.

### Response Data Integration

As a compliance officer, I want utility member responses automatically imported, so that I can track which utilities have cleared the work area.

When the scraper captures response data from utility members, the sync script should create or update those responses in the database, maintaining the complete response history for each ticket.

## Spec Scope

1. **Data Parsing** - Read and parse the scraped JSON file containing ticket data
2. **Data Transformation** - Convert scraped fields to API-compatible format with date parsing and field mapping
3. **Ticket Sync Logic** - Check ticket existence and create/update as needed with full data overwrite
4. **Response Sync** - Process and sync utility member responses for each ticket
5. **Error Handling** - Robust error handling with detailed logging and partial failure recovery

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the existing scraper code
- Complex data reconciliation or merge logic
- Real-time sync or webhook integration
- Deduplication of response data
- Historical data preservation (updates overwrite)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Python script that successfully syncs all tickets from a scraped JSON file to the database
2. Proper handling of date/time conversions and field transformations
3. Clear logging output showing sync progress and any errors encountered
