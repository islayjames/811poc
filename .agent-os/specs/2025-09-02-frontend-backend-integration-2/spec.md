# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Frontend-Backend Integration
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Wire the existing frontend UI components to the existing backend API endpoints with minimal code changes. This spec focuses strictly on replacing mock API calls with real API integration without modifying UI components or adding new features.

## User Stories

As a contractor using the dashboard, I want the UI to display real ticket data from the backend so that I can see actual ticket statuses instead of mock data.

As a system administrator, I want the frontend to successfully communicate with the backend API so that all CRUD operations work end-to-end.

As a developer, I want minimal code changes during integration so that existing UI logic remains intact and stable.

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
- Replace mock API calls in existing frontend components
- Set up API client configuration for backend communication
- Wire GET endpoints for tickets list and detail views
- Wire POST endpoints for ticket creation and validation
- Wire PATCH endpoints for status updates
- Implement error handling for API failures
- Create Playwright tests to verify integration works
- Ensure existing UI components display real data correctly

### Integration Points
- Dashboard ticket list display
- Ticket detail view with real data
- Status update functionality
- Ticket creation workflow
- Validation feedback display

## Out of Scope

- UI component modifications or redesigns
- New features or functionality
- Backend API changes or new endpoints
- Authentication implementation
- Performance optimizations beyond basic error handling
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- New pages or routing

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional frontend that communicates with the existing backend API, displaying real ticket data in the existing UI components with all CRUD operations working through Playwright-verified integration tests.
