# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-gis-parcel-enrichment-#4/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Create CAD Resolvers Configuration
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for CAD_RESOLVERS structure validation
  - [ ] 1.2 Create cad_resolvers.ts with TypeScript interfaces (skipped - Python only per user request)
  - [x] 1.3 Implement CAD_RESOLVERS const with 4 county configurations
  - [x] 1.4 Add county name normalization helper function
  - [x] 1.5 Create Python equivalent cad_resolvers.py for backend
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all tests pass

- [x] 2. Implement Core Parcel Enrichment Function
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for enrichParcelFromGIS function
  - [x] 2.2 Create parcel_enrichment module structure
  - [x] 2.3 Implement enrichParcelFromGIS with error handling
  - [x] 2.4 Add coordinate validation and bounds checking
  - [x] 2.5 Implement feature_found logic and matched_count tracking
  - [x] 2.6 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 3. Build ArcGIS Query Client
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for fetchParcelFeature function
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement query parameter construction
  - [ ] 3.3 Add HTTP client with timeout support
  - [ ] 3.4 Implement response parsing and field mapping
  - [ ] 3.5 Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all tests pass with mocked responses

- [ ] 4. Integrate with Validation Pipeline
  - [ ] 4.1 Write integration tests for validation flow
  - [ ] 4.2 Modify validation endpoint to call parcel enrichment
  - [ ] 4.3 Update ticket model to include parcel_info structure
  - [ ] 4.4 Ensure enrichment failures don't block validation
  - [ ] 4.5 Add comprehensive logging throughout pipeline
  - [ ] 4.6 Run end-to-end tests with all counties
  - [ ] 4.7 Verify all integration tests pass

## Implementation Order

The tasks should be completed in sequence as listed, as each builds on the previous:
1. Configuration establishes the county mappings
2. Core function provides the main enrichment logic
3. ArcGIS client handles the external API communication
4. Pipeline integration completes the feature

## Testing Strategy

- Each major task includes writing tests first (TDD approach)
- Use mocked ArcGIS responses for unit tests
- Integration tests will use actual endpoints with known coordinates
- Performance tests should verify < 2 second response times

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Successfully enriches parcels for all 4 counties
- [ ] Gracefully handles unsupported counties
- [ ] Cache hit ratio > 80% in testing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
