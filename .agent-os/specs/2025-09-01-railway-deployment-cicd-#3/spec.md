> Status: Planning

## Overview

Deploy the Texas 811 POC backend API to Railway with persistent JSON storage and automated CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment. This deployment will make the API publicly accessible and ensure data persistence across container restarts while enabling automatic updates on code changes.

## User Stories

### DevOps Engineer Story

As a DevOps Engineer, I want to deploy the Texas 811 API to Railway with proper configuration, so that the API is publicly accessible and maintains data persistence across deployments.

The deployment begins with configuring Railway for the FastAPI application, setting up persistent storage for JSON files, and configuring all necessary environment variables. Since Railway containers are stateless, I need to implement a solution for persisting tickets, sessions, and audit logs. The deployment should include health checks and proper CORS configuration for production use.

### Developer Story

As a Developer, I want automatic deployment when I push to the main branch, so that my changes are immediately available in production without manual intervention.

After the initial manual deployment, pushing code to the main branch should trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to Railway. This workflow should handle environment variables securely, run basic validation checks, and ensure zero-downtime deployments. The process should be transparent with clear success/failure notifications.

### System Administrator Story

As a System Administrator, I want persistent storage for JSON data files, so that ticket data, session information, and audit logs survive container restarts and redeployments.

The system needs to store JSON files outside the ephemeral container filesystem. This could use Railway Volumes, external object storage (S3/GCS), or a simple solution like Google Drive API for the POC. The storage solution should automatically restore data on container startup and periodically backup during operation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Railway Deployment Configuration** - Set up Railway project with proper build and start commands for FastAPI
2. **Persistent Storage Solution** - Implement JSON file persistence using Railway Volumes
3. **Environment Variable Management** - Configure secrets in Railway and GitHub for API keys and configuration
4. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline** - Create workflow for automatic deployment on main branch pushes
5. **Health Monitoring** - Ensure health check endpoints work in production environment

## Out of Scope

- Multiple environment deployments (staging, development)
- Database migrations (using JSON storage)
- Custom domain configuration
- Load balancing or scaling
- Backup automation beyond basic persistence

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working API deployed to Railway accessible via HTTPS URL with all endpoints functional
2. JSON data persisting across container restarts with automatic save/restore mechanism
3. GitHub Actions workflow successfully deploying on pushes to main branch with zero-downtime
